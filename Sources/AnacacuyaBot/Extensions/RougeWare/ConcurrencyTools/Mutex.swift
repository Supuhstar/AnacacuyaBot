/// A mutual-exclusivity async lock which maintains strict structural concurrency.
///
/// Only one task at a time can read or change the value. If a second task tries to access it while the first is still working, it waits in line until its turn comes.
///
/// Tasks are served in the order they arrived (first-in, first-out), so no task can be skipped or starved.
///
/// Basic usage:
/// ```
/// let balance = Mutex(100)
///
/// await balance.run { value in
///     value += 50
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can also use this as an exclusive access queue without a value:
/// ```
/// let mutex = Mutex()
///
/// await mutex.run {
///     loadNextValue()
/// }
/// ```

    /// The protected held value
    private var value: Value
